## System Requirements

You must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of python may not compile.

## Steps to Replicate 

1. Fork this repository and create a codespace in GitHub as I showed you in the youtube video OR Clone it locally.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sudarshan-koirala/langchain-falcon-chainlit.git
   cd langchain-falcon-chainlit
   ```

2. Rename example.env to .env with `cp example.env .env`and input the huggingfacehub api token as follows. Get Huggingfacehub api token from this [URL](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). You need to create an account in Huggingface if you haven't already.
   ```
   HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   ```

   OPTIONAL - If you want to use LangSmith. Get this [URL](https://smith.langchain.com/). You need to create an account in LangSmith website if you haven't already. 
      ```

      LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
      LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
      LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="your-project"
      ```

3. Run the following command in the terminal to install necessary python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the following command in your terminal to start the chat UI:
   ```
